A comprehensive web-based unit conversion application that handles conversions between SI, US Customary, and a unique Seximal measurement system (base-6 notation using only digits 0-5). The app displays all three systems simultaneously with easy dimension switching (length, mass, area, volume, temperature, pressure, etc.) at the top level, and allows users to tap any system to change specific units within that system (e.g., switching between inches, feet, yards, miles in US Customary). Each system serves as both input and output - users can enter values in any of the three systems and see real-time conversions in the other two, with Seximal conversions including both unit conversion and base-6 numerical conversion.

Core Features:
- Multi-dimensional unit conversion across SI, US Customary, and Seximal systems
- Interactive dimension selector for length, mass, area, volume, temperature, pressure
- Tap-to-change unit selection within each measurement system
- Real-time bidirectional conversion with any field as input/output

Seximal Conversion Values (some given to US Customary, some given to SI):
Time: 1 tujo = 0.07716 seconds
Length: 1 tumbo = 2.29867 inches
Area: 1 surfao = 5.28388 square inches
Volume: 1 voluo = 199.0345 mL
Speed: 1 pido = 0.75668 m/s
Acceleration: 1 gravito = 9.80664 m/s^2
Mass: 1 mazo = 199.0345 g
Force: 1 forso = 1.95186 N
Pressure: 1 premuo = 0.08304 psi
Work/Energy: 1 nergo = 0.11396 J
Temperature: 1 grado celsia = 1°C
Frequency: 1 freko = 12.96 Hz
Power: 1 paŭo = 1.47694 W

In addition to these conversions, note that Seximal has various factors, just like how SI has milli-, centi-, kilo-, etc. representing powers of 10. For Seximal, the powers of 6 are:
6^1: unse-
6^2: duse-
6^3: trise-
6^4: kvarse-
6^5: kvinse-
6^6: sese:
6^-1: undo-
6^-2: dudo-
6^-3: trido-
6^-4: kvardo-
6^-5: kvindo-
6^-6: sedo-
